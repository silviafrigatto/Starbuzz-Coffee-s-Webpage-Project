              <h1>Starbuzz meets social media</h1>
              <p>
              Here at Starbuzz we're embracing the social media craze. In fact,
              we're going further than any of our competitors and we're very close…
              </p>
              <p>
              Sound like science fiction? It's not; I'm already testing our final
              prototype social network cup as I write this…
              </p>
              <p>
              So, keep your eyes out for this amazing new cup. And I'll be
              releasing a video teaser soon to tell you all about this new invention,
              straight from Starbuzz Coffee.
